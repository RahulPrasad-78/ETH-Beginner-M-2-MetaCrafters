# Project Title

Integration of React Frontend with Ethereum Smart Contract

## Description

This project demonstrates the integration of a React frontend with an Ethereum smart contract deployed on the blockchain. The smart contract includes basic functionalities for depositing, withdrawing, staking, and burning tokens, while the React frontend allows users to interact with these functionalities through MetaMask integration.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites


Follow these steps to set up and deploy the contract using Remix IDE:

Ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js
npm (Node Package Manager)
MetaMask extension for your browser.

### Ethereum Smart Contract Deployment

  1. Deploy the Assessment.sol smart contract on a test network like Rinkeby using Remix IDE or a similar development environment.

  2. Note the deployed contract address (contractAddress) and the ABI (atm_abi) for configuring the React frontend.

## Usage
  1. Connect MetaMask to your desired Ethereum network.

  2. Navigate to the deployed React application (http://localhost:3000) and connect your MetaMask wallet.

  3. Interact with the smart contract:
  View account information and current balance.
  Deposit, withdraw, stake, and burn tokens using the respective buttons.

## Functionality
### Deposit
Allows the contract owner to deposit Ether into the contract.

### Withdraw
Allows the contract owner to withdraw Ether from the contract.

### Stake
Allows the contract owner to stake Ether into the contract.

### Burn
Allows the contract owner to burn Ether from the contract.

## Help

For common issues or problems, you can refer to the Remix IDE documentation or check the console for error messages.
